            <p>
                <strong>The Gentle Push</strong> is a decision-support tool designed for people experiencing decision fatigue.
                When your mind feels overloaded, a simple yes or no response can help break the loop of indecision — giving you just enough clarity to take the next step.
            </p>

            <p>
                This app was inspired by the mental drain of all the decisions you deal with day to day. From small choices like what to eat, to larger ones like when to take action — we often freeze under the weight of too many options.
                <em> The Gentle Push</em> offers assistance.
            </p>

                <em>Decision fatigue affects productivity, confidence, and wellbeing. By automating small decisions or helping you pause for reflection, this app creates space for more meaningful thinking.</em>
