  <h2>About The Gentle Push</h2>
  
  <p>
    <strong>The Gentle Push</strong> is a minimalist decision-support tool designed for people experiencing decision fatigue.
    When your mind feels overloaded, a simple yes/no/maybe response can help break the loop of indecision — giving you just enough clarity to take the next step.
  </p>

  <p>
    This app was inspired by the mental drain of modern life. From small choices like what to eat, to larger ones like when to take action — we often freeze under the weight of too many options. 
    <em>The Gentle Push</em> offers lighthearted assistance with a thoughtful design and just a hint of humor.
  </p>

  <h3>Why It Matters</h3>

    Decision fatigue is real — and it affects productivity, confidence, and wellbeing. By automating small decisions or helping you pause for reflection, this app creates space for more meaningful thinking.
  </p>

  <h3>How It Helps</h3>
  
    <p> Delivers simple, unbiased answers to yes/no/maybe questions </p>
    <p> Offers encouragement when you need a boost</p>
    <p> Lightens the moment with a relatable meme</p>

  <h3>Not Just a Toy</h3>
  <p>
    Inspired by the Magic 8 Ball, but built for real-world grown-ups, <strong>The Gentle Push</strong> is for anyone juggling responsibilities, overthinking daily decisions, or just needing an external nudge.
  </p>

    “You don’t need to have it all figured out. Sometimes, all you need is a gentle push.”
